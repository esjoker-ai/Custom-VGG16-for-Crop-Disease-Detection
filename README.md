# Custom-VGG16-for-Crop-Disease-Detection
This project implements a custom deep learning model for detecting crop diseases from images. The solution uses a custom-designed VGG16-style architecture, rather than a pre-built model, as its base. The model is then fine-tuned for the specific task of crop disease classification.
